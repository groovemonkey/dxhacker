First I was a soldier, fighting for freedom (or so I thought). I came home, but my left arm wasn't working right since taking some shrapnel in Iran. So I pulled a number at the Veteran's Affairs office and waited. A few months later, I was a janitor, studying finance at night school. I was replaced by a Branden Industries Series A, a little robot on wheels that cost as much as I made in a year.

The bank was still giving personal loans to veterans, then, so I finished my studies as fast as possible and got an entry-level accounting job.

Again, automated. A better piece of software made me unnecessary, and I lost the job. They gave me three months pay because they were sorry to let a veteran go. I guess it was a good deal...

After the financial crash, no one was hiring, so I went on welfare. Thank god I fought in that god damn war. Even though I've got a lifetime of nightmares from it, at least I'm guaranteed welfare, unlike a lot of other poor bastards out there.

I'm so tired of this waiting game. If I don't hear back from Jessica soon, I'm going to go crazy. I know I can't trust the police or anyone else, but she's been missing for two days now and I'm running out of explanations in my head. God dammit. All I wanted was to find out the truth, and now all I want to do is forget it.

Yes, I hacked into a computer -- the personal computer of a Branden Industries exec. I just wanted to embarass them because their piece-of-shit robots keep malfunctioning and injuring people at the barracks...but what I found was much worse than I expected.

I told Jessica, who said we had to contact one of the news outlets, so they could expose Branden Industries. She got in touch with some reporter there and told me not to worry.

God, I hope she comes home soon.
