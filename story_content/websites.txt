Engineering The Future!
We make some of the most groundbreaking mechanized worksaving machines in existence today. Flying Drones, Ground Drones, Armored Drones (for extra-dangerous work!), surveillance drones, and all the weaponry that goes along with them. We of course turn a small profit by selling to (mostly) governments, but that doesn't distact us from our overall mission of "Charity, Accountability, and Making The World A Safer Place (tm)."

We've built schools in Africa and Asia, and even pay for our employees' healthcare! Our core value of "Doing Good (tm)" is always at the forefront of our synergistic, strategic vision plan.
